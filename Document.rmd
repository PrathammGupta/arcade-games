## 10. Appendices

### 10.1 Minor, Major, and final Victory conditions
Minor: Minor victories include players surviving the waves of asteroids thrown at them so their overall score will increase, And destroying said asteroids is also a minor victory.
Major: Major victories are deafeating the boss at the end of each level so the player gets to continue onto more difficult challenges
Final: the Final victory condition is defeating the Final boss and completing the game, potentially with a new high score.

### 10.2 Minor and Major loss Conditions
Minor: the minor loss condition is taking any damage as this pushes you closer towards running out of lives and increases the pressure of the game.
Major: the major loss condition is running out of lives, as this causes a game over and the player will have to try again from the beginning.

### 10.3 Active Challenges

#### 10.3.1 Manuevering the ship
What the PLayer does: the player controls the ship by rotating left and right, moving forwards and backwards, and shooting. using these controls the player must shoot at and avoid enemies. What is shown to the player: the player is first shown the ship they control, they get to see it moving and see the projectiles as they shoot. they will then be shown the asteroids and alien ships they must avoid and destroy. What validates the players actions: over time as the player survives longer they will gain more points, also for destroying asteroids and alien ships they will collect even more points totalling up to a potential high score.

#### 10.3.2 Deafeating boss ships
what the player does: the player must shoot at the boss ships until they have taken enough damage to be destroyed. what is shown to the player: whenver the player hits the boss ship a small animation is played to let the player know they are acheiving something, an animation will also be shown when the ship is finally destroyed. What validates the players actions: when boss ships are defeated the player will recieve a lot of points and will move onto the next level of the game, when the final boss ship is destroyed the player will have beaten the game.

### 10.4 Game Rules

#### 10.4.1 Operational Rules
Dodging Enemies: The player must manuever the ship so that they are not hit by any asteroids or attacks from the boss ships, failing to do so will cause the player to lose a life and eventually a game over. this is a global rule which impacts the current game that is being played, meaning this rule has no effect on the game after a game over.
Collecting Power-ups: the player can collect power-ups that spawn, these power-ups may restore lost lives or make their shooters more powerful. this is a global rule that affects the current game being played.

#### 10.4.2 Constitutive Rules
Destroying enemies: The player can use their shooters to destroy asteroids and boss ships that appear, the asteroids can be dodged but the boss ships must be destroyed to progress to the next level, this will challenge the player into balancing controlling the ship so they dont lose lives, while also giving them oppurtunities to do damage so tehy can progress in the game. this is a global rule.

#### 10.4.3 Inplicit Rules
Getting high scores: As the player plays through the game they will gain points, these points have no affect on the gameplay but the high scores will be recorded in the game. players can earn points through surviving over time and destroying enemies. this rule impacts on the all games of asteroids as the high score is recorded and set as a goal for all players to beat.

### 10.5 Internal Economy

#### 10.5.1 Tangible Resources

##### 10.5.1.1 Powerups
What value Does It Have: Powerups help the player progress through the game and the rate they drop may vary depending on the game state the player is in.
How Is It Exchanged In The Game: As asteroids and boss ships are destroyed they may drop powerups for the player, if the player has previously lost health then these powerups are more likely to restore the players lost health, where if the player has almost full to full health then these drops are more likely to power up the players ship with upgrades.
Negative Feedback Mechanism: Powerups will only drop if the player is actively destroying asteroids, as the game can be played by just dodging instead of destroying the asteroids, the player must actively destroy asteroids for the chance to get any powerups.
Positive Feedback Mechanism: Better powerups are more likely to drop if the player is successfully not taking any damage and playing the game better, while if the player takes damage the powerups will try and get them back into a healthier state in the game.
Random Elements: Some powerups amy end up not being entirely usefull to the player, such as their still being a chance for health to drop while the player is at full health.

#### 10.5.2 Intangible Resources

##### 10.5.2.1 Player Health
What value Does It Have: PLayer health shows how many times the player can still be hit before a game over, the health value of a player also has an effect on the drop rates of different powerups.
How Is It Exchanged In The Game: 1 health is lost whenever the player takes damage form an asteroid or enemy ship, if the player health reduces to zero it results in a game over. Health points can be regained by picking up health drops from enemies.
Negative Feedback Mechanism: More powerups will be replaced with health drops if the player is not at full health.
Positive Feedback Mechanism: Health drops will despawn after a little while if not collected.
Random Elements: the health drops to refill lost health are dopped randomly form enemy kills so there is never a guarantee that you will recieve a drop when you need one.

##### 10.5.2.2 Score
What value Does It Have: Score is a display letting the player know if they have been doing well over the course of the game.
How Is It Exchanged In The Game: Score is gained overtime, so the longer a player survives the more score they will acheive. score can also be gained from destroying asteroids and enemy ships.
Negative Feedback Mechanism: score can only be gained as fast as enemies spawn in, so score will rise quicker in later game stages when more enmies spawn at a time.
Positive Feedback Mechanism: score naturally goes up as time progresses in the game so as talemate is never a possibility with score.
Random Elements: the rate and way enemies spawn is random so the amount of score that can be gained form defeating enemies each game will vary slightly.

### 10.6 Player Psychology

#### 10.6.1 Goals and Strategies

##### 10.6.1.1 PLayers Must Deafeat the Boss Of the Level
Psychological Strategy: Classical Conditioning
How the game design employs this mechanism: The boss of each level must be defeated so that the player can move onto the next level and progress further into the game. The Game will not progress until the boss is defeated.
How this mechanism acheives the goal: Players will associate the boss as being a roadblock that is stopping them from getting to the end of the game, as well as identifying the boss as something that they cannot simply dodge like they do the asteroids.

##### 10.6.1.2 Players Can Play For High Scores
Psychological Strategy: Flow Theory
How the game design employs this mechanism: As players get better by playing the game more they will keep wanting to create new high scores to show off their skill in the game, going for high scores will allow players to get easilt comfortable and acheive a flow state where they start to internalize the game and mechanics.
How this mechanism acheives the goal: Everytime the player acheives a new high score they will associate how well they did in that run with being their current skill ceiling, pushing them to want to raise it to acheive even higher scores.

##### 10.6.1.3 Players Can Collect Powerups
Psychological Strategy: Classical Conditioning
How the game design employs this mechanism: Players understand that running out of lives will cause a game over and they will have to start again from the beginning of the game, so collecting powerups and extra lives will help to prevent this.
How this mechanism acheives the goal: players will associate the boosts that they get from powerups to being able to more effectively and easily get through levels of the game. And collecting extra lives will also allow them to go further into the game.

##### 10.6.1.4 Duo Players Must Work Together
Psychological Strategy: Bartle's Character Theory
How the game design employs this mechanism: When played in duo mode, Players will be able to work together to increase the efficiency at which they deal with obstacles present in the game, allowing for relationship growth and cooperation.
How this mechanism acheives the goal: Players will associate needing each other to play as well as they can, if both players can stay alive they will be able to more effectively progress through the game.
