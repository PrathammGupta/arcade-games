9/12/2023 -  Castiel next steps TODO: Revise current code and make more efficient/encapsulate as possible. This includes breaking up a lot of the board class methods, moving block height/width to the board class. Board class should just be able to pass coordinate info to the block instead of the block having to calculate where it should be.
Fix up comments. Also need to prevent block from moving left or right if there is another block there. Need to update UML diagram as it has changed a lot after the original basic thoughts. Make a function to compare block colour.
