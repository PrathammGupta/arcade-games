## _Introduction_
The team has decided to create a clone of the game 'Breakout', by using C++ and Splashkit to demonstrate the capapbilities available to splashkit. Swanny and Norman have been the coder's behind the game, while Tulsi has worked on the documentation, and Harney have worked on both documentation and the game sprites. The game is made to assist future students in developing games and understanding the fundamentals of C++ and the coding language with Splashkit. Breakout is one of two new products being developed, alongside the Asteroid's game done by Phil Williams, Riley Michael and Ro Wern Ong.

## _Purpose of the game_ (Tulsi)
(purpose of the game can be demonstrating capabilities (as mentioned above) as well as exploring the capabilities of using splashkit to create a game to be used in arcade machines and raspberry pi in the future.)
## _Steps Involved in making the game_ (Tulsi)
1. C++ language
2. drawing environment
3. Controlling player along x axis 
4. Coding ball movement
1.Continuous along y axis
2.Bounce on walls and bricks
3.End if fallen to the ground
5. Destroy block when colliding with ball and add score
6. End/Next level when all bricks are destroyed
7. Optional features
1.Multiple balls
2.larger ball
3.bigger paddle (or platform)
4.score multiplier.
8. Multiple levels
9. Different types of bricks.
    


## _Details of Game_
The brick breakout game is a simple game where the player must destroy bricks of a wall in order to proceed to the next level. The game is based off of the games Break out, and DX-ball, as shown below.
![DX-Ball](https://images.sftcdn.net/images/t_app-cover-l,f_auto/p/0f5173aa-96da-11e6-9405-00163ec9f5fa/4242823519/dx-ball-2-screenshot.jpg)
The game would run by allowing the player to move left and right, or the x axis, to slide the platform across, while the ball bounces between the walls and the bricks, and the goal is to break all the bricks without losing the ball. The player would need to ensure the ball is able to be deflected off of the platform each time it returns, or the player will lose a life. After losing all lives, the player would be met with a game over screen.
As the player progresses on, they can find the levels become more challenging, and discover different types of bricks and power ups:
Power ups would include:
1. Multiple balls
2. larger ball
3. bigger paddle (or platform)
4. score multiplier.
(further power ups could be added in the future, such as 'fire balls', or 'bombs' to explode large chunks of bricks.)

The plan is (currently) to have 10 levels created, with each level increasing in difficulty and new bricks. This is to limit repetition and adding a challenge to the player. 
Once the player has successfully completed all 10 levels, the player would be met with a end screen congratulating them, presenting their highscore and pressing a button to restart the game.
