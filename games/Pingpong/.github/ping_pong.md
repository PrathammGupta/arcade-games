## PingPong Game Pull Request

### Description
The proposed enhancements for the game include resolving issues related to collisions, such as allowing the ball to pass through pipes upon vertical collision, fixing the problem of the ball moving into walls upon vertical end collisions, and implementing a mechanism for the ball speed to progressively increase during each round for added excitement. Additionally, bug fixes are planned for the end screen, along with the introduction of a map switch feature that enables background changes through a button. Moreover, players will have the ability to switch between different ball types by pressing a designated button. To enhance visual appeal, animation effects will be integrated into the initial and concluding screens, potentially using different SVG files to address performance concerns.
