Description:

To introduce a progressive diﬃculty curve and enhance player engagement, the

ball speed will incrementally increase within each round.

Implement a dynamic speed adjustment mechanism, gradually increasing the

ball speed as players progress through the game. This can be achieved through a

deﬁned algorithm or formula.

**● Map Switch**

Description:

Allow players to switch the background by pressing a designated button,

providing a visual refresh and enhancing the overall gaming experience.
